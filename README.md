# Reactify
**A feature-rich web client for Spotify built with React and Redux.**

Current production build can be viewed [here](https://reactify.herokuapp.com) (requires a Spotify account due to restrictions on their public API).

### Current Features:

* Search all of Spotify for artists, albums or playlists.
* Artist profiles containing their full catalogue of music as well as top tracks, related artists and other stats.
* Browse Spotifys highlights including new releases, featured playlists and categories.
* View your own profile to see your recently played tracks, top artists and playlists.
* Manage your playlists, including adding and removing tracks, updating playlist names and images.
* Full music player functionality including track-seeking, shuffle and repeat (songs are limited to the 30 second previews however).
* Responsive UI that works from mobile to desktop.

#### Features I'm looking to add in future:

* Audio Equalizer feature.
* Generating custom playlists based off of seeds.
